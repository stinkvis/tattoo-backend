                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Tattoo inspiration is scattered across social platforms without artist credit, making it hard to find who created the work and even harder to discover new artists.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>Artist-first portfolios with guaranteed attribution, detailed style tags, and location-based discovery so every piece leads back to the person behind the needle.</p>
